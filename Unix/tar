In order to "zip" a directory, the correct command would be

tar -zcvf archive.tar.gz directory/ 

This will tell tar to c (create) an archive from the files in directory (tar is recursive by default), compress it using the z (gzip) algorithm, store the output as a f (file) named archive.tar.gz, and v (verbosely) list all the files it adds to the archive.

To decompress and unpack the archive into the current directory you would use

tar -zxvf archive.tar.gz
