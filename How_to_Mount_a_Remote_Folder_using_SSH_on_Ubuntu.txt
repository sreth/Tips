First we’ll install the module:

sudo apt-get install sshfs

Now we will use the modprobe command to load it

sudo modprobe fuse

We’ll need to set up some permissions in order to access the utilities. Replace
<username> with your username.

sudo adduser <username> fuse

sudo chown root:fuse /dev/fuse

sudo chmod +x /dev/fusermount

Since we’ve added ourselves to a user group, we need to logout and back in at
this point before we continue.

Now we’ll create a directory to mount the remote folder in. I chose to create
it in my home directory and call it remoteserv.

mkdir ~/remoteserv

Now we have the command to actually mount it. You’ll be prompted to save the
server key and for your remote password.

sshfs <username>@<ipaddress>:/remotepath ~/remoteserv

Example: 
sshfs root@bos1-floor11-dhcp117-36:/vmfs/volumes/4e0e1364-1c8b3a91-eb2c-0030487cf7a2/Results ~/Desktop/Results/
