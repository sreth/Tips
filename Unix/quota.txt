Cannot login to GUI with valid password

This looks like the .Xauthority file is corrupted. Try this in a tty:

sudo mv .Xauthority .Xauthority_backup

Then restart lightdm and try to log in again:

sudo service lightdm restart

If that was not the cause, restore the file to its previous state:

sudo mv .Xauthority_backup .Xauthority
